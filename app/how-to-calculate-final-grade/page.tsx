              Calculating your final grade is essential for academic planning and success. Whether
              you want to know what score you need on your final exam to get an A, or you're
              curious about how your current performance will affect your overall outcome,
              understanding the calculation process is crucial.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Our calculator uses a straightforward formula that takes into account your current
              grade and exam weight to determine exactly what you need to achieve your target.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Most courses use a weighted grading system where different components contribute
              different percentages to your overall grade. For example, homework might be 20%,
              quizzes 20%, midterm 30%, and final exam 30%. To calculate accurately, you need to
              understand how each component contributes and what exam score is needed to reach your
              desired outcome.

              The Final Grade Calculation Formula
            </h2>
            <div className="bg-primary/10 dark:bg-primary/20 rounded-xl p-6 mb-8">
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">
                Basic Formula
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-200 font-mono text-lg mb-2">
                Final Grade = (Current Grade × Current Weight) + (Final Exam Score × Final Weight)
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 text-sm">
                Where Current Weight = 100% - Final Exam Weight

            </div>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              To calculate your grade, multiply your current grade by the percentage it represents
              of your total, then add the final exam score multiplied by its weight.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              For instance, if your current grade is 85% and represents 70% of your total, and your
              final exam is worth 30%, the calculation would be: (85 × 0.70) + (Final Exam Score × 0.30).
              This formula is the foundation for understanding exactly how your exam performance will
              impact your overall outcome.

                      Many professors provide this information on your course portal, or you can

                      is crucial because it determines how much impact your exam score will have on
                      your overall outcome. A higher weight means the exam has more influence.

                      score you need on the final exam. Be realistic—if you currently have a 70% and
                      the final is only worth 20%, getting an A might not be mathematically possible.

                      For example, if you have an 85% current grade, want a 90% final grade, and
                      your final is worth 30%: (90 - 85 × 0.70) ÷ 0.30 = (90 - 59.5) ÷ 0.30 =
                      101.67%. This means you would need over 100% to reach your goal, so you might
                      need to adjust your target or look for extra credit opportunities.

                  When you calculate your final grade, remember that 30% should be 0.30 in the
                  formula, not 30. This is one of the most common errors in final grade calculations,
                  and it can throw off your final grade by several points.

                  Using the Wrong Current Grade

                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Make sure your current grade reflects all completed work, not just your most
                  recent test. A final grade calculator needs accurate input to give you reliable
                  results, and an outdated average can drag your final grade lower than expected.

                  Ignoring Dropped Grades or Curves
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Some professors drop the lowest quiz or curve final grades. Factor these policies
                  into your calculations, as they can significantly affect what you need to achieve
                  your target final grade and can even boost your final grade without additional work.

              <h2>Stay Organized and Focused</h2>
              <p>
                Begin each week by reviewing your current standing and identifying tasks that will
                have the biggest impact. This ritual keeps your priorities organized and tied to
                measurable outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Break large assignments into checkpoints and note the weight of each milestone. When
                you understand how much every step influences your outcome, you can schedule focused
                work sessions instead of rushing before deadlines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Share your academic roadmap with a mentor or tutor. Talking through your targets out
                loud often reveals hidden obstacles and sparks creative solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                After every quiz or paper, pause to celebrate progress and adjust your tracker.
                Seeing trends in real time reinforces good habits and highlights areas that deserve
                extra attention.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Log your goals at the top of every study session agenda</li>
                <li>Color-code planner entries based on assignment weights</li>
                <li>Celebrate progress, even small improvements</li>
                <li>Review your projections twice a month to stay on track</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Remember that success is the cumulative result of consistent effort. Keep refining
                your systems so your semester outcome reflects both skill and strategy.
