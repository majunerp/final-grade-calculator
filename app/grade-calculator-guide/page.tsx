        <h1>Complete Grade Calculator Guide</h1>
        <p className="lead">
          Learn how to turn raw assignment scores into actionable insights so you can plan every class with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guide begins with the fundamentals because the clearest path to reliable grades is understanding how numbers convert into progress. You'll learn to map each course component, spot trends that matter, and prevent last-minute surprises that derail a term.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
        <p>
          Start by gathering your syllabus, recent assignment scores, and any rubrics your instructors provide. Record your current averages and highlight categories that still carry significant weight. This guide is designed to be iterative, so revisit it weekly to keep your plan accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Set checkpoints that match your school calendar. When you attach due dates and milestone exams to your planning, you create a living document that pushes you to prepare earlier, communicate with professors sooner, and maintain momentum deep into the semester.
        </p>

            >
              <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">{card.title}</h3>
              <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
                {card.points.map((point) => (
                  <li key={point} className="flex gap-2">
                    <span className="mt-0.5 h-2 w-2 rounded-full bg-primary"></span>
                    <span>{point}</span>

          ))}
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Weighted Categories</h2>
        <p>
          Weighted grades can feel intimidating, but breaking them down into manageable chunks makes them easier to understand. List each category—homework, labs, quizzes, exams—and mark its percentage weight. By comparing category weights side by side, you immediately see which tasks offer the biggest return on effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plot sample scenarios to understand your options. For example, if labs count for 15% and you currently average 78%, calculate how raising that average to 90% affects the whole picture. Each scenario gives you clarity about where additional study time will make the most difference.
        </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-white mb-3">Weighted Category Checklist</h3>
          <ul className="space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-200">
            <li>Verify each percentage with your syllabus before entering scores.</li>
            <li>Keep a column for notes about dropped scores or bonus opportunities.</li>
            <li>Run “what-if” scenarios whenever assignments are added or policies change.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Setting Realistic Goals</h2>
        <p>
          Goal setting is more than a motivational quote—it's a precise calculation. Identify your desired outcome, then reverse engineer the path to get there. Because you're using actual course weights, your goals remain realistic, measurable, and aligned with the time you have left.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pair each goal with actionable tasks in your weekly checklist. When you can trace a direct line from a target to specific habits, you're less likely to procrastinate and more likely to sustain progress.
        </p>

        <h2>Tracking Progress and Momentum</h2>
        <p>
          Track your average after every quiz, project, and exam. Input new scores as soon as they're released to highlight shifts in momentum. If your average dips, you'll quickly identify the source—perhaps a string of low quiz scores or a missing assignment that needs immediate attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consistency transforms your tracking into a personal dashboard. Over time you'll see patterns, such as performing better on morning exams or struggling with timed quizzes. These insights help you adapt your study routine before the next assessment.
        </p>

        <h2>Scenario Planning for Finals</h2>
        <p>
          Grade planning becomes indispensable during finals season. Simulate best-case, likely-case, and worst-case outcomes for each course. Every scenario tells you the exact score required on remaining assessments to meet your goal, which eliminates guesswork.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you share your plan with study partners or tutors, everyone understands your priorities. Clear communication about where you can afford to lose points and where perfection is necessary helps your support team tailor advice that matters.
        </p>

        <h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h2>
        <p>
          Students often misinterpret grading policies. Always verify whether instructors drop the lowest score or offer bonus points. These reminders save you from planning around inaccurate information. Before every major exam, confirm that policies remain the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another mistake is treating grade tracking as a one-time exercise. Instead, schedule weekly check-ins to update your records while reviewing feedback from instructors. This habit ensures your data reflects your most current standing, not a snapshot from the beginning of the term.
        </p>

        <h2>Integrating Study Strategies</h2>
        <p>
          Grade planning is most effective when paired with intentional study strategies. Allocate study blocks proportional to category weight—a 30% final should earn 30% of your prep time. If group work influences your grade, build collaboration sessions into your schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Take advantage of learning resources such as campus tutoring centers or online practice banks. Each resource aligns with the skills that produce higher scores, making study time more efficient.
        </p>

        <h2>Long-Term Academic Planning</h2>
        <p>
          While this guide focuses on current courses, it also supports long-term planning. Monitor how each class impacts your cumulative GPA, scholarship requirements, or graduate school prerequisites. By extending your planning beyond a single term, you protect future opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're juggling internships or extracurricular obligations, systematic tracking helps balance commitments without sacrificing performance. As you add new responsibilities, adjust study blocks to keep grade goals on track.
        </p>

        <h2>Putting It Into Action</h2>
        <p>
          Keep a checklist visible on your desk or tablet. Every time you input a new score into our calculators, record the change and reflect on what worked. Your tracking system acts as both a logbook and an accountability partner.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you complete a semester, archive your records for future reference. Reviewing past entries shows how your study strategies evolved and reminds you which tactics delivered the biggest improvements. Build a personal library of success strategies you can revisit in future courses.
        </p>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
